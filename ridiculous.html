	<h1>Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
	<p>Way back when in grade school, we had to have our recess inside most of the time since our playground was undergoing changes. At the time, we were allowed to bring electronics into school, like our DSs and battery operated toys. Everyone was connected with each other, and we all played together and got along fine...for the most part.</p> <p> then our batteries died and we did not know how to socialize with others </p>
<h2>The Fight that Ended it All</h2>
	<p>One day, two boys, two grades above me, got into a fight over their tamagotchi toys. A few minutes later, the verbal argument became something bigger: The one boy broke the other boy's toy. Because of their verbal argument and the destruction of a personal item, every grade was prohibited to bring in any toys from home. We were stuck indoors either being forced to draw or play 7 up. Being stuck in the classroom during playtime was no longer fun and felt forced.</p>
